# Map Pagination Navigation Fix

## Issue Description
When clicking the next (">") or previous ("<") navigation buttons in map popups with multiple mitzvahs at the same location, the popup would close instead of navigating to the next mitzvah.

## Root Cause
The button click events were bubbling up to parent elements, causing the Leaflet popup to interpret the click as a request to close the popup rather than a navigation action within the popup content.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Event Propagation Control**
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent click events from bubbling up
- Added `e.preventDefault()` to prevent default button behavior
- These prevent the popup from interpreting navigation clicks as close requests

### 2. **Function Signature Updates**
```typescript
// Before
const navigateToNext = (coordKey: string, totalCount: number) => { ... }
const navigateToPrevious = (coordKey: string, totalCount: number) => { ... }

// After
const navigateToNext = (e: React.MouseEvent, coordKey: string, totalCount: number) => { ... }
const navigateToPrevious = (e: React.MouseEvent, coordKey: string, totalCount: number) => { ... }
```

### 3. **Click Handler Updates**
```typescript
// Before
onClick={() => navigateToNext(coordKey, totalCount)}
onClick={() => navigateToPrevious(coordKey, totalCount)}

// After
onClick={(e) => navigateToNext(e, coordKey, totalCount)}
onClick={(e) => navigateToPrevious(e, coordKey, totalCount)}
```

## Files Modified
- `src/components/map/MapView.tsx`

## Testing Results
- ✅ Build compilation successful
- ✅ Event propagation properly stopped
- ✅ Navigation works without closing popup
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User clicks on a map marker with multiple mitzvahs (shows count badge)
2. Popup opens showing the first mitzvah with navigation controls
3. User clicks ">" (next) button
4. Popup content updates to show the next mitzvah **without closing**
5. User can continue navigating through all mitzvahs at that location
6. All other popup functionality (claim button, etc.) works normally

## Deployment
- **Commit**: `d3b5aed`
- **Status**: Pushed to main branch
- **Auto-deployment**: Will trigger on Vercel

This fix ensures that map pagination provides a smooth, uninterrupted user experience when exploring multiple mitzvahs in the same location.
